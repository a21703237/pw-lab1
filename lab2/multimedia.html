        <br>        
        ...once bitten twice smitten kid in a candy shop will drop his Thai baht money as there is no way out as to ever leave here… as he yearns to become wanton in fiery incision with incurable desires within this hideous overload of sensual persuasions of kitsch and splendor vile derision…     
        <br>   
        Better wear tightly a neck brace as the Thai traits of beyond gorgeous dolls trolls and trollups  
        <br>      
        Will beckon your embrace where even Ulysses could not be bound by sailors ropes as the sheer grasp with Herculean strength of a he man will snap the mast of the voyagers ship as you slip into the abyss of her to die for jup jup kiss…   
        <br>     
        He will wish away his all until his head takes in all of the bliss and soon he cries tears of blood.
